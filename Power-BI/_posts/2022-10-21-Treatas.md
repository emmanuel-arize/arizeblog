In this tutorial, we’ll dive into the DAX TREATAS function in Power BI. I will in the first section of this tutorial show how to create a virtual relationship between two tables  and then move on to show how we can simplify filtering expression using the TREATAS function.

### Virtual Relationship using TREATAS
The Best practice to move a filter from one table to another is to create a physical relationship between the two tables
involved. What if the relationship doesn't exist, is there a way to create virtual relationship between these two tables to
 mimic a physical relationship so that the user thinks the is relationship in place, even if there is none? Using DAX functions 
 I will create virtual relationship between tables that mimic physical relationship. This technique is useful whenever a relationship does not exist. 
 In order to show how we can create a virtual relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables, I have deleted the physical relationship 
 existing between these two tables using data from 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/DAX/Adventure%20Works%20DW%202020.pbix">Adventure Works DW 2020<a/>
 
 which can be seen from the data model below 

<br>

<br>

Without any physical relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables, let look at the amount of sales by country using <a href="https://daxstudio.org" target="_blank"> DAX Studio</a>

```{DAX}
EVALUATE
	SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
              Reseller[Country],
             "Sales Amount",[Sales Amt]
	)
```

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas2.jpg' |relative_url}}" >

From the preceding figure we see that the result for the sum of sales amount is the same for all the countries involved because there no relationship between the two tables.

Using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/treatas-function"> TREATAS</a> which apply the result of a table expression as filters to columns from an unrelated table and define as

```{dax}
TREATAS(table_expression, <column>[, <column>[, <column>[,…]]]} )
```

we can create a virtual relationship between the two tables to propagate the filter context from Reseller to Sales using the TREATAS function and is given by the code below.

 <br>
<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas3.jpg' |relative_url}}" >

Using TREATAS we connected the two tables using the ResellerKey column, and the preceding figure shows that the amount of sales is filtered by Country, even though there is no physical relationship between the two tables.

Let now create a physical relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables using the ResellerKey column in power BI as  below

<br>
<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas4.jpg' |relative_url}}" >
<br>

With a physical relationship between the tables let check if we will get the same result for the amount of sales filtered by country as that of the virtual relationship.

### Filtering Values Using TREATAS
In this section of the tutorial we will be filtering values using the TREATAS function. Before we start using TREATAS to filter values, we need to create two calculated columns since TREATAS filters using columns and the columns needed for the filtering are not part of data model.

Let add two calculated two columns name **Year** and **Month Num** to the date table which contain the year and the number representing the month.
<br>
```{DAX}
Year = YEAR([Date])
```
<br>

```
Month Num = MONTH('Date'[Date])
```
<br>

With these calculated columns let now create two measures **2018/19 Sales** and **2018/19 Sales_T** which filter the amount of sales for 2018 and 2019. Using the filter function and TREATAS function respectively.

<br>

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas7.jpg' |relative_url}}" >
<br>

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas8.jpg' |relative_url}}" >
<br>

Let now use the report canvas to display the values for the two measures created
<br>

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas9.jpg' |relative_url}}" >
<br>

Continuing the filtering examples let create additional two measures **12-2018/1-2019 Sales** and **12-2018/1-2019 Sales_T** which filter the amount of sales for 12/2018 and 1/2019, using the filter function and TREATAS function respectively and where 1 and 12 represent months. For instance 1=January.

<br>

Let now use the report canvas to display the values for **12-2018/1-2019 Sales** and **12-2018/1-2019 Sales_T**
