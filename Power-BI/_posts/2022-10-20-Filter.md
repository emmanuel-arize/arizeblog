This tutorial illustrate how to filter a table using the FILTER function in DAX. Whether you are a data scientist, a marketing or sales person, filtering data is one of the most common ways you analyze data. The FILTER function is often used to filter rows of a table  reducing the size of the table. When table is filtered, the resulting data is a subset of table and this presents an opportunity to prepare for future analysis.


The syntax of FILTER is given as:
```
FILTER ( <table>, <condition> )
```
Using this syntax FILTER receives a table and a logical condition as parameters. In order to return a result, it iterates the table evaluating the condition on a row-by-row basis and returns all rows satisfying the condition.

Let now create a measure **Canada Sales** that finds the amount of sales from Canada

```
Canada Sales = CALCULATE(
                        Sales[Sales Amt],
                        FILTER(
                                Customer,
                                Customer[Country-Region]="Canada"
                              )
                      )

```
Result from the **Canada Sales** measure shows only sales where Customers are from or in Canada

Let create another measure **Canada USA Sales** that filter the table to return sales where a customer is either from Canada or United States,

```
Canada USA Sales = CALCULATE(
                            Sales[Sales Amt],
                            FILTER(
                                    Customer,
                                    Customer[Country-Region]="Canada" || Customer[Country-Region]="United States"
                                    )
                            )
```

Result from the **Canada USA Sales** measure shows only sales where Customers are from either Canada OR United States
