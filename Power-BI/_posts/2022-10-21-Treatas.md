In this tutorial, we’ll dive into the DAX TREATAS function in Power BI. Using the TREATAS function we can create a virtual relationship between two tables  and can also used  to simplify filtering expression. In the first section of this tutorial I will use the TREATAS function to create a virtual relationship between two tables and then used it in the last section to simplify a filtering expression.

#### Virtual Relationship
The Best practice to move a filter from one table to another is to create a physical relationship between the two tables.
What if the relationship doesn't exist, is there a way to create virtual relationship between these two tables to mimic a physical
relationship so that the user thinks the is relationship in place, even if there is none?. Using DAX functions we can create virtual relationship between tables that mimic the physical relationship and in this tutorial I will show how to create a virtual relationship using the TREATAS function. In order to show how we can create a virtual relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables, I have deleted the relationship between these two tables which can be seen from the data model below

Without any physical established relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables, let look at the amount of sales by country using <a href="https://daxstudio.org" target="_blank"> DAX Studio</a>

```{DAX}
EVALUATE
	SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
              Reseller[Country],
             "Sales Amount",[Sales Amt]
	)
```

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas2.jpg' |relative_url}}" >

From the preceding figure we see that the result for sales amount is the same for all the countries involved because there no relationship between the two tables.

<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/treatas-function"> TREATAS</a> Applies the result of a table expression as filters to columns from an unrelated table and is define as

```{dax}
TREATAS(table_expression, <column>[, <column>[, <column>[,…]]]} )
```

With this definition let now create a virtual relationship between the two tables to filter the amount of sales by Country using  the TREATAS function. <br>
<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas3.jpg' |relative_url}}" >

We connected the two tables using the ResellerKey, and the preceding figure shows that the amount of sales is filtered by Country, even though there is no physical relationship between the two tables.

Let now create a relationship between the Reseller and Sales tables using ResellerKey in power BI as  below

<img class="w3-center w3-brown" src="{{'/assets/images/power_bi/treatas4.jpg' |relative_url}}" >

With an established relationship between the tables let check if we will get the same result
for the amount of sales filtered by country as that of the virtual relationship

## Filtering Values Using TREATAS
In this section of the tutorial we will be filtering values using the TREATAS function
