In this tutorial I will be illustrating how to use EXCEL IF function. The IF function is one of the most used functions in Excel which returns values based on a **true** or **false condition**.The condition here is referred to as logical_test and the function has the following syntax.

```
=IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])
```

For example, =IF(A2=100,"High","Low") says IF(A2= 100, then return High, otherwise return Low).
